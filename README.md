Data structures are essential organizational formats for storing and managing data efficiently. They enable optimal data access, manipulation, and retrieval, impacting algorithm performance and system efficiency.
Arrays: Fixed-size collections of elements, allowing indexed access for efficient retrieval.
Linked Lists: Composed of nodes with values and pointers, allowing dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions/deletions.
Stacks: Follow Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, enabling operations like push and pop for managing data.
Queues: Use First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, suitable for tasks like scheduling and buffering.
Hash Tables: Store key-value pairs, offering fast data retrieval through hashing.
Trees: Hierarchical structures with nodes, ideal for representing sorted data and enabling quick searches.
Graphs: Composed of vertices and edges, useful for representing relationships and networks.
